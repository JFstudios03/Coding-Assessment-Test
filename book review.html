            <br>We are very much aware of the harmful
            <br>effects of corruption as it relegates
            <br>development efforts to the background
            <br>plunging countries into underdevelopment. A

            As emphasized in the opening address of the Executive director,
            CISLAC, Auwal Ibrahim Musa(Rafsanjani), the shadow report focuses
            mainly on the anti-corruption agenda, in particular on SDG 16,
            which specifically addresses illicit financial and arms flows
            bribery and other forms of corruption, and access to information.
        <p>
            He said: "We are very much aware of the harmful effects of corruption
            as it relegates development efforts to the background plunging countries
            into underdevelopment. A society free of corruption is healthy, wealthy,
            well respected and well developed."
        </p>
        <p>
            "We are well aware of the religious, socio-cultural, political and ethnic
            turbulence threatening to tear apart the fabrics of the society we live in.
            For this purpose, it has become imperative that as civil society organizations,
            we take up the mantle of our constitutional mandate to steer the tide of peaceful
            and just society."
        </p>
        <p>
            "As civil society organizations, our key mandate to our communities is to pursue
            and advocate for peaceful inclusiveness and corruption free society that will in
            turn translate to the sustainable development that we seek."
        </p>
        <p>
            The executive director stressed the need to harness local and international institutions
            to strengthen efforts in promoting peace and unity including traditional and religious
            institutions which drive the conscience of the common man.
        </p>
        <p>
            "We need to conscientize these institutions to exude and imbue peace in their followers for
            the purpose of a peaceful society. The entertainment industry is not left out of this. As
            much as possible, we need to utilize every media that attracts the people to spread this joy
            of peaceful co-existence."
        </p>
        <p>
            "We call on other civil society groups and media across Africa and beyond to lend their voices
            to the clarion call on peace and stability and to promote justice and fairness irrespective of
            class or race," he highlighted.

            On the new Global office, CISLAC's boss explained that the launching coincided with the UN
            General Assembly 72 and the international Day for Peace which...
